                <h2>Create Some Space</h2>
                <p>Designate a workspace at home for those late nights. <br> This can be anywhere you have access to a flat surface <br> and adequate lighting that allows you to concentrate — a <br> desk, your kitchen table, a reading chair, just not your <br> bed! This helps your mind and body understand when <br> you’re in working mode and allows you to more <br> effectively transition to “home” mode when you’re done.</p>

                <h2>Stay Focused <br>on Work</h2>
                <p>In addition to your workload, you probably also have a <br> to-do list that includes going grocery shopping, washing <br> the dishes, and doing laundry. And it’s probably making <br>you sweat just thinking about how you’ll manage to get<br> everything done. My advice: Compartmentalize.<br> Prioritize the urgent to-do (your work project), and let<br> yourself off the hook with the others.

                <h2>Quit Multitasking</h2>
                <p>On a similar note, don’t try to fit in the fun stuff on an <br> evening or weekend when you need to be working. If <br> you’re trying to squeeze in writing a blog post during the <br> commercial breaks of American Idol, chances are it <br> won’t be that good, and you’ll end up spending more <br> time on revising it later. Either commit to taking a break <br> from work for some fun or getting everything done now <br> so that you can enjoy yourself fully later.<br><br>

                Working after hours is one of those unfortunate facts of <br> life, but you can create rituals and boundaries that
